                        <strong>June 1999 </strong>- Silent Hill 2 was starting its development after the first game was complete and released. This was some time around February. Since Silent Hill was a financial success, <a id="Konami" href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Konami" class="refer" target="_blank">Konami</a> is moving forward with 
                        a sequel.<a id="Team-Silent" href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Silent" class="refer" target="_blank"> Team Silent</a> also wanted to work on a sequel, but they were frustrated with the limitations of the Playstation during the development of Silent Hill and aimed to seek more creative freedom with the Playstation 2.
                        Konami assigned Team Silent the role for developing the sequel. Team Silent made some changes to some team members' roles. <a id="Sato" href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Takayoshi%20Sato" class="refer" target="_blank">Takayoshi Sato</a> eturns to create computer-generated graphics, character designs, create the premise of 
                        the game while taking inspiration from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's <a id="c&c" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment" class="refer" target="_blank">Crime and Punishment</a>, and lead the main writing for the game's story along with <a id="Owaku" href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Hiroyuki%20Owaku" class="refer" target="_blank">Hiroyuki Owaku</a>

                        avoid the typical sounds that can be heard from something like <a id="re" href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/" class="refer" target="_blank">Resident Evil</a> and go for something that will challenge the imagination.<a id="Imamura" href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Akihiro%20Imamura" class="refer" target="_blank">Akihiro Imamura</a> was the producer of the game and help 
                        brought 30 people from Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo to work on Silent Hill 2. Increasing a small team of 10 people to 50-60 people. The story idealized first then the game was developed out of that. The team wanted to focus on psycological horror and wanted 
                        the player to reflect the evil of Silent Hill. They wanted to combine the elements of horror and drama to create an atmosphere that will horrify players.

                <h3>Reception</h3>
                <br>
                <p id="reception-info" class="reception-info">When the original copies of the Playstation 2 versions were released, the game was generally highly rated. As well as the Xbox releases. However the PC port was recived mixed reviews. As for the game itself, it was priased for its plot, chilling atmosphere, 
                    soundtrack, graphics and its gameplay. All of theses elements was a good push in the right direction for survival horror games. At the time, reviewers thought the game was a worthy sequal to the first game but they thought it wasn't better then the original due to 
                    the lack of traditoinal horror elements that were present in the first game, there was more ammo compaired to the first game, and some monster can be easily avoided. Some commented on the fog of Silent Hill created a sense of claustraphbia while others may call it a limitation
                    of the graphical capabilities of the Playstation 2. The game was praised for its transitions to the computer generated graphics cutscenes to in-game cutscenes. Character animations where consered realistic at the time. The voice acting was had a mixed respose where reviewers thought 
                    the voice acting was well done due to the improved scripted while others thought it was the voice acting was incosistant with some of it line deliveries. Most of the reviewers loved the monster designs. As for the Xbox release, the game was simliar to the original Playstation 2 version
                    except for the "Born from a Wish" side-scenario found in this version of the game. "Born from a Wish" recived mostly mixed reviews. Others called it an accpetible extra while others called it a demo. The PC port recived mixed reviews due to keyboard controls and camera issues. 
                    9 years later Silent Hill 2 and 3 were given a remaster that help to improve the graphics with the new graphical capabitlies of the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and released them under Silent Hill HD Collection. The release was not well recived to critics and fans on release and today. 
                    They a majority of people disliked the new voice acting, it suffered masive framerate issues, crashes, some of the next textures that they added to the game is worse than the original, graphical glitches and cleared most of the fog which ruins the atmopshere of Silent Hill. Most of the
                    techincal and visual bugs where fixed a couple of years later on Silent Hill 2 but only on the Playstation 3 version and nothing was changed for Silent Hill 3. The way that the games turned out liked that it was because the games where outsourced to a different company to remaster the game
                    and they were handed an version of Silent Hill 2 and 3 with unfinished code because Konami somehow lost the complete builds of those games. Silent Hill 2 is considered one of the best Playstation 2 games or the best video games of all time to many major video game critic 
                    outlet such as IGN, Game Informer, Wired News, GamePro and others. </p>
                    <p id="my-spoiler">Myself included</p> <p class="reception-info">Silent Hill 2 is still holds up well in today's current climate of video games as of 2023, with emulation, fan-made patches to make the game play and look great while retaining its original visuals and gameplay of the game.                        
                </p>
                <h3 id="SH2-where" class="headings">Experince Silent Hill 2</h3>
                <p class="reception-info">
                    There are mutiple ways that you can experince Silent Hill 2 in today's climate of video games of 2023. You can wait until the remake comes out or you can play Silent Hill 2 right now.
                </p>
                The ways you can play Silent Hill 2
                <ul id="play-sh2"> 
                    <li><strong>Remake</strong> - <a id="remake" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" class="refer" target="_blank"> wait until the remake comes out</a></li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Emulation (My Recommandatoin)</strong> - You can emulate the Playstation 2 via <a id="pcx2" href="https://pcsx2.net/" class="refer" target="_blank">PCX2</a> and find a copy of either the original PS2 version of Silent Hill 2 or the "Greatest Hits"/"Director's Cut" version of Silent Hill 2 ISO. The only caviot to this appoach is you need to get a bios of a Playstation 2. But its the second best way of experincing Silent Hill 2 in my opion</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>PC Enhanced Edition (My recommandation)</strong> - If you can manage to find the PC version of you can use the fan-made patch of Silent Hill 2 called <a id="SH2EE" href="https://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/" class="refer" target="_blank">Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition</a> which supports high-defintion resolutions, upscaled fonts, images and videos, improved controller and keyboard and mouse controls, widescreen support, restored fog and post-processing effects, 60FPS+ and more
                    The only caviot is you will have to find the PC version of Silent Hill 2. The PC version is techincally abandonware due to Konami's practices but its Konami still own the IP and they are not currently selling this version of the game</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Silent Hill HD Collection</strong> - The most accessible way to play Silent Hill 2 currently, is through a copy of the Silent Hill HD Collection. Not the most ideal way to play Silent Hill 2 due to the issues that are still present in both versions of Silent Hill 2. If you still have a Playstation 3 I would recommend getting that version of the collection because it has the fixes implementated into that version into the collection compaired to
                        the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-hd-collection/C1NL49GLS561" class="refer" target="_blank">360 version </a> no fixes were implementated. Otherwise you can play Silent Hill 2 via Xbox One's backwards compatibity. However this is be the worst way to go about it.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Oringal Hardwar</strong> - If you can afford it, you can always buy the copy of Silent Hill 2 and you can run it off of a Playstation 2 or Xbox. However this is an expensive option </li>
